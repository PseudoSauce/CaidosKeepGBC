Caidos Keep
=============

Welcome to Pseudo Sauce's open source code of Caidos Keep!

Caido's Keep is a 3rd-person role playing game. Originally developed by a group of 5 Game Programmers for an assignment for school.

Installation
----------------------

The steps below will take you through cloning your own private fork, then compiling and running the editor yourself:

### Windows

1. Install **[Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** and **[Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)** then fork and clone our repository.

1. Install **Visual Studio 2015**. 
   All desktop editions of Visual Studio 2015 can build UE4, including [Visual Studio Community 2015](http://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs).
   Be sure to include C++ support as part of the install, which is disabled by default.

1. Install **[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com)** version 4.13.x. We're currently using 4.13.1.

1. Launch the engine and in the Unreal Project Browser, refresh to have the project pop-up. If it doesn't show up, click the 'Browse...' button at the bottom right of the window and navigate to the project repo and open the '.uproject file'.

Additional Notes
----------------

It might take you several pulls to fully download the whole project even with LFS. And vice-versa for pushing. 
This shouldn't happen that often as long as your repository is up-to-date.
